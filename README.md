# Ultimate Life Function (ULF)

The Ultimate Life Function (ULF) is a unified mathematical framework
that models intelligent behavior and life-course dynamics as an
optimization process under stochastic constraints.

ULF formalizes well-being, decision-making, and cognitive dynamics
using stochastic differential equations, Fokker–Planck PDEs,
variational principles, and optimal control theory.

It proposes a life-optimization functional that integrates
happiness biology and systemic resilience into a single
long-horizon objective function.

## Abstract

This work introduces the Ultimate Life Function (ULF), a theoretical
framework that models human life trajectories as an optimization
problem over probability distributions evolving under stochastic
dynamics.

The system state is represented as a high-dimensional manifold
describing physiological, cognitive, and social variables.
Its evolution follows a Fokker–Planck equation, while long-term
life evaluation is defined by a variational functional combining
happiness and resilience.

ULF connects neuroscience, control theory, statistical physics,
and decision science into a unified mathematical structure.
